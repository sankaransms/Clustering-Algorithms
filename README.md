# Clustering-Algorithms

## **About EdTech**

The leading EdTech platform is an advanced tech-university offering intensive courses in computer science and data science. These programs, curated by industry leaders and subject matter experts, are designed to upskill software professionals through modern curricula and cutting-edge technologies. The platform focuses on equipping learners with the knowledge, practical exposure, and industry-ready skills required to succeed in top-tier technology companies.

## **Problem Statement👀**

You are tasked as a data scientist within the analytics vertical of this leading EdTech platform to analyze and cluster learners based on their job profiles, companies, and related features. The objective is to derive meaningful clusters that reflect shared characteristics among learners, enabling deeper insights into employment trends, company segments, and learner career progression.

## **Objective🎯**

1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset and clean it for processing.
2. **Cluster learners** based on attributes like:
   - Current job profiles
   - Employment start year
   - CTC details
   - Company identifiers  
3. Generate actionable insights and recommendations by:
   - Profiling companies, positions, and salary distributions.
   - Highlighting top and bottom performers based on various metrics.
4. Utilize **manual and unsupervised clustering techniques** to create meaningful groupings and analyze their implications.

## **Concepts Used📑**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Statistical summary of features
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates and cleaning text with regex

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new features like years of experience
   - Generating flags (Designation, Class, Tier) for manual clustering

3. **Manual Clustering:**
   - Analyzing learner performance and categorizing based on:
     - Company, job position, and years of experience
     - Salary distribution and company-specific averages

4. **Unsupervised Learning:**
   - **K-means clustering**: Determining optimal clusters using the elbow method
   - **Hierarchical clustering**: Understanding hierarchical relationships within data
   - Standardizing and encoding data for clustering

5. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Profiling top and bottom employees and companies
   - Identifying key trends in salary distributions and positions
   - Providing strategic business recommendations for Scaler
